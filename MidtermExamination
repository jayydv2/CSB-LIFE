1.) Yes, I failed an exam already, the reason why I failed the exam because,
I took the exam for granted and I didn't review well and I did something
not really important than reviewing.

2.) CSB Midterm examination is different from my Ex-High School School.
CSB Midtern is 5times harder than the other exams of the other universities
(For me). I'll study hard 5times more. I'll focus on all of my subjects.
Like as I Said I'll review harder than the normal.
