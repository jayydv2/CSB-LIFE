QUOTE:

“Do not be disheartened by the difficulties you experience.”

My reaction to this quote are, St. John Baptiste De La Salle is telling that, don't loose hope there's always a chance to do better, you don't need to take it seriously or deeply. Because God provide a better life to us. I think St. John Baptiste De La Salle, want to state that god always have a plan of each and everyone of us, if you fail in our first try or fail in our life, it means god is telling me or us, that is not for us, Do other things, do better, make a good decision and it's not our path to take on. Its a challenge that god will challenge us, if we will take the wrong path that will lead us to Roughness in our life or in Good path, that will lead us to success and better living. And my other reaction is Difficulties in our life will not block our life to be successful, Difficulties in our lives is a Challenge, Challenge to Finish, Challenge to win, and Challenge to Choose whether you want to win or want to lose it out. In short, Difficulties is not an excuse to stop dreaming to be successful, Difficulties are just a distraction to us, for us to stop believing to our self, to stop reach our goal and for us to throw all the things we've made. Take that as a Challenge not a Hesitation to Give up.
